# Python based Interview Assignment


Assumptions -
1. The JSON, CSV and XML files will be present in the given locations.

2. The format of all these files will be valid and aligned with the way communicated in the questions. If required, extra steps can be added to ensure that the format/schema of the files are in alignment with the requirement.

4. I have used naming conventions of naming methods and variables etc with lowercase words separated by underscores.

5. I have used print statements as a way to print useful information related to the state of the system at any point but we can change it to a logging library so that we can log proper contextual and structured log messages with a very minimal overhead/performance impact.

6. I have not used any extensive parameterization method but if needed (if these codes are part of some bigger codebase used in live/production systems), we can start fetching the various parameters/configurations from some other system/library/framework like Consul etc.

7. I have not made an exhaustive effort to ensure that we keep the output files in consistent state at all times and not save any data half baked in some edge cases.

8. We can use virtualenv based environment to run these codes.

9. Most likely, there will be opportunities to optimize the code to increase the performance of these codes if they become bottlenecks in a process.

10. I have not written unit tests etc around these codes but if required, automated tests can be written to ensure good code quality and proper functionality.

11. Proper exception handling has been used.
